# Project3DPrint
I design 3D printed parts for fun and print it using the 3D printer of my own lab. This projects include scoop design to box design for WiFi light control, and automatic door control. As I design new stuff I will share all the projects in this repository. Feel free to download and customize your own parts.

These projects are designed in Solidworks and printed using monoprice maker select V2 printer.
